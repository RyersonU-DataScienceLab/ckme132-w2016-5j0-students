## Introduction

- this presentation is based on _Introductory Statistics with R_, _Chapter 2: The R environment_
- this is an R Markdown presentation
    - Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents
    - R Markdown let's you combine R input and output, including graphs, with text
    - for more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## 2 The R environment

- this chapter describes how to work with the R environment
- it describes
    - workspaces
    - graphical devices and their parameters
    - elementary programming
    - data entry


## 2.1 Session management

- your interaction with R occurs within the context of a **session**
- in RStudio there is
    - a session associated with the console
    - a temporary session created whenever you Knit an R markdown document

## 2.1.1 The workspace

- whenever you create a variable, it gets added to the workspace
- list all the variables in your workspace using the `ls()` function

```{r}
ls()
```

- the result of `ls()` is a character vector of variable names
- we haven't created any variables in this session yet so the list is empty
- run all the commands we executed in Chapter 1

```{r message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(knitr)
knit('iswr-ch01.Rmd')
```

- now list the variables again to see what was created
```{r}
ls()
```

- you can remove unneeded variables using `rm()`
- remove `height` and `weight`

```{r}
rm(height, weight)
```

- you can remove all variables from the workspace by giving `rm()` a list argument
    - you can also remove variables using RStudio menu commands

```{r eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```

- by default, `ls()` omits variables that begin with a dot (.) since these are normally system variables
- you can really list ALL the variables (but don't delete them!)

```{r}
ls(all=TRUE)
```

- you can save the state of your workspace and restore it later

```{r eval=FALSE}
save.image()
```

- by default the image is saved to a file named `.Rdata`
		- you can also provide a file name
- the R environment prompts you to save the image when you quit
- the workspace image file `.Rdata` is loaded by default when you start a new session
- you can save and load individual R objects using `save()` and `load()`

```{r}
bmi
save(bmi, file='bmi.Rdata')
bmi <- 1:3
bmi
load('bmi.Rdata')
bmi
```

## 2.1.2 Textual Output

- the workspace does not contain the output you generate
- you can copy and paste output from the console
- you can divert output to a file using `sink()`
    - of course, it is better to use R markdown!

```{r eval=FALSE}
sink('myfile')
ls()
sink()
```

- R looks in the working directory if you don't specify the file path
- get the working directory using `getwd()`

```{r}
getwd()
```

- set the working directory using `setwd()`

```{r}
(work.dir <- getwd())
setwd('/Users')
getwd()
setwd(work.dir)
getwd()
```

- the initial working directory depends on how you start R
- you can configure RStudio to start in a specific working directory

## 2.1.3 Scripting

- the console is great for interactive exploration
- when you are finished exploring you will want to store your R code in a file so you can repeat them easily
- you can store R code in a plain `.R` script file or a `.Rmd` markdown file
    - you can run a script file using `source()`
    - you can run a markdown file using `knit()`
- you can develop R code files interactively using a script editor
    - the script editor lets you run individual lines of code

- for example, consider the script `norm-hist.R`
    - opens a PDF graphics device
    - plots a histogram of the normal distribution
    - closed the graphics device

```{r}
cat(readLines("norm-hist.R"), sep="\n" )
```

- run the script using `source()`, echoing the lines

```{r}
source('norm-hist.R', echo = TRUE)
```

- R maintains a history of all the commands you enter
- display the most recent commands using `history()`
- save and load the history using `savehistory()` and `loadhistory()`

## 2.1.4 Getting help

- R has many more commands than you can possibly memorize
- R has an extensive built-in help system
- use the RStudio menus or enter help commands in the console
- launch the help browser using `help.start()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help.start()
```

- look up help for a specific function, e.g. `plot`

```{r}
help("plot")
```

- or use the shortcut

```{r}
?plot
```

- get a list of commands that refer to a topic

```{r}
apropos("mean")
```

- display a help page of commands that refer to a topic
```{r}
help.search("mean")
```

- read "An Introduction to R" which comes with the R distribution:
    - <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf>

## 2.1.5 Packages

- an R installation contains one or more **libraries** of **packages**
- some packages are part of the basic installation
- other packages can be downloaded from CRAN (more than 6,000)
- you can create your own packages

- a **library** is a folder on your disk
- a **system library** is a library that is created when R is installed
- you may not have file permission to modify the system libraries
- you may be able to create private user libraries (see `help(".Library"))`

- a package contains specialized function 
    - not needed by everyone
- a package may contain:
    - R code
    - data sets
    - dynamically loadable native code (usually C or Fortran)
    
- you load a package using `library()`

```{r}
library(survival)
```

- loaded packages are not part of the workspace
- you must reload any needed packages when you start a new session
- you can remove a loaded package using `detach()`

```{r}
detach("package:survival")
```

## 2.1.6 Built-in data

- many packages contain large data sets
- to avoid excess memory consumption, many packages implement **lazy loading**
- with lazy loading, the data set appears to be available but is not actually loaded into memory until the data is referenced for the first time
    - e.g. `thuesen` in the `ISwR` package is available but not actually loaded
- some packages require that you explicitly load data using `data()`

```{r}
data("thuesen")
```

- `data()` searches the data directories of the loaded packages for a file with the specified base name
    - subdirectories named `data` are also searched
- if a match is found then actions are performed depending on the file extension
    - `.tab` files are read using `read.table()`
    - `.R` files are executed using `source()`

## 2.1.7 `attach` and `detach`

- R maintains a **search path** of scopes for looking up variables

```{r}
search()
```

- `.GlobalEnv` (at position 1) is the set of variable defined in the workspace
- when you reference a variable, R checks each scope in the search path for the variable and returns the first one it finds
    - a variable in earlier scopes on the search path will **mask** variables with the same name in later scopes
    - if R is searching for a variable of a specific type, e.g. a function, then it will skip variable of the same name that are of a different type
    
- you can abbreviate access to the components of a data frame by adding it to the search path using `attach()`

```{r}
attach(thuesen)
search()
```

- R adds the data frame immediately after `.GlobalEnv`, i.e. at position 2
- with `thuesen` on the search path, instead of writing `thuesen$blood.glucose`, write just `blood.glucose`
```{r}
blood.glucose
```

- attached data frames always come after the workspace on the search path
- you can make R search a given data frame before the workspace by using `with()`

```{r}
with(thuesen, plot(blood.glucose, short.velocity))
```

- remove a data frame from the search path using `detach()`

```{r}
detach()
search()
```

- by default, the data frame in position 2 is removed
    - you can give `detach()` an argument to remove a specific data frame

## 2.1.8 `subset`, `transform`, and `within`

- R provides some additional functions to make referencing components of a data frame easier
- use `subset()` to select a subset of the rows of a data frame based on a condition

```{r}
thue2 <- subset(thuesen, blood.glucose < 7)
thue2
```

- you can also use `subset()` on a vector
- this is the same as indexing the vector except that `NA` entries are excluded
```{r}
v1 <- c(1,2,3,NA,5,6,7)
subset(v1, v1 < 6)
```

- `select()` has an argument `select` which let's you select which variables from the data frame to select

```{r}
subset(thuesen, blood.glucose < 7, select = short.velocity)
```

- use `transform()` to create new components of a data frame

```{r}
thue3 <- transform(thuesen, log.gluc=log(blood.glucose))
head(thue3)
```

- `transform()` does not allow **chained** calculations
    - the new variables can only depend on the existing variables
- use `within()` for more complex transformations

```{r}
thue4 <- within(thuesen, {
  log.gluc <- log(blood.glucose)
  m <- mean(log.gluc)
  centered.log.gluc <- log.gluc - m
  rm(m)
})
head(thue4)
```

- `within()` collects all the variables defined in the **compound statement** and returns them in a data frame
    - note how the intermediate variable `m` was removed using `rm()`


## 2.2 The graphics subsystem

- R lets you generate simple plots
- you can superimpose a curve on it
- you can modify the default behaviour
    - add annotations
    - change the axes
    - use labels instead of numbers
    - use irregularly placed tick marks
- there other graphics packages, which are not covered in ISwR
    - `grid`
    - `lattice`
    - `ggplot2`

## 2.2.1 Plot layout

- the R graphics model defines a figure region (for a single plot)
    - central plotting region
    - margins
- coordinates in the plotting region are specified in **data units**
- coordinates in the margins are specified in 
    - **lines of text** perpendicular to the axis
    - **data units** along the axis
    
- a standard **x-y plot** has
    - an x-axis title
    - a y-axis title
    - a main title above the plot
    - a subtitle below the plot

```{r}
x <- runif(50, 0, 2)
y <- runif(50, 0, 2)
plot(x, y, main="Main title", sub="subtitle", xlab="x-label", ylab="y-label")
```

- you can place additional points and lines in the plot either when the plot is created or after using `points()` and `lines()`
- you can place text in the plot using `text()`
    - use `abline()` to draw vertical and horizontal lines in this example

```{r}
plot(x,y)
text(0.6,0.6, "text at (0.6,0.6)")
abline(h=0.6,v=0.6)
```

- use `mtext()` to place text in the margins
  - use line coordinates

```{r}
plot(x,y)
for(side in 1:4) mtext(-1:4, side=side, at=.7, line=-1:4)
mtext(paste("side", 1:4), side=1:4, line=-1, font=2)
```

## 2.2.2 Build a plot from pieces

- high-level plots are composed of elements, each of which can be drawn separately with finer control
- to achieve ultimate control, draw the plot without the element, then add it
- the following code draws nothing but sets the coordinate system of the plot
    - `type="n"` suppresses drawing the points
    - `axes=F` suppresses drawing the axes and the box surrounding the plot

```{r}
plot(x,y, type="n", xlab="", ylab="", axes=F)
```

- now add the elements

```{r}
plot(x,y, type="n", xlab="", ylab="", axes=F)
points(x,y)
axis(1)
axis(2, at=seq(0.2,1.8,0.2))
box()
title(main="Main title", sub="subtitle", xlab="x-label", ylab="y-label")
```

- plotting points with `type="n"` is also useful for establishing the overall coordinate system of the plot when you want to plot several groups of data
- plot the entire set of points with `type="n"`
- then plot each group using `points()` in a different colour
- alternatively, plot all points at once using a vector argument for `col`

## 2.2.3 Using `par`

- use `par()` to set graphics parameters for multiple plots
- some parameters can only be set using `par()
- you can set the following
    - line width and type
    - character size and font
    - colour
    - style of axis calculation
    - size of the plot and figure regions
    - clipping
    - etc.
- you can divide a figure into subfigures using `mfrow` and `mfcol`

- e.g. reduce the margin sizes from the default of `c(5,4,4,2)`
```{r eval=FALSE}
par(mar=c(4,4,2,2)+0.1)
```

## 2.2.4 Combining plots

- combining plots requires some considerations in order to produce a good result
- the following code is not good enough

```{r}
set.seed(42)
x <- rnorm(100)
hist(x,freq=F)
curve(dnorm(x),add=T)
```

- the problem is that the peak of the curve may get clipped because its height was not taken into account in the histogram
- the solution is to compute the actual limit of the y-axis

```{r}
h <- hist(x, plot=F)
ylim <- range(0, h$density, dnorm(0))
hist(x, freq=F, ylim=ylim)
curve(dnorm(x), add=T)
```

## 2.3 R programming

- the main focus of this book is using the available packages to do statistics
- however, you can also write your own functions in R
- this allows you to easily reuse code
- as an illustration of the power of R programming, let's wrap the preceding plotting code in a function

```{r}
hist.with.normal <- function(x, xlab=deparse(substitute(x)), ...)
{
  h <- hist(x, plot=F, ...)
  s <- sd(x)
  m <- mean(x)
  ylim <- range(0, h$density, dnorm(0, sd=s))
  hist(x, freq=F, ylim=ylim, xlab=xlab, ...)
  curve(dnorm(x,m,s), add=T)
}
```

- the default value for `xlab` is set to the expression used for `x`
- the `...` argument indicates other arguments which can then be passed to the other plot function calls
- now let's call this function

```{r}
hist.with.normal(rnorm(100, mean=4, sd=2))
```

- you can learn more about R programming by looking at the definition of other people's functions
- print the definition of a function the same as you print the value of any other variable

```{r}
hist.with.normal
```

## 2.3.1 Flow control

- R is a true programming language
    - conditional exectution
    - looping
- the following code computes $x = \sqrt{y}$ using Newton's method


```{r}
y <- 12345
x <- y/2
while (abs(x*x - y) > 1e-10) x <- (x + y/x)/2
x
x^2
abs(x^2-y)
```

- a `while` loop executes a statement while a logical condition is `TRUE`
- a `repeat` loop excutes a statement until you `break` out of it

```{r}
x <- y/2
repeat {
  x <- (x + y/x)/2
  if (abs(x*x - y) < 1e-10) break
}
x
```

- here the `repeat` loop executes a **compound** statement which consists of several other statements enclosed by `{ }`
- the `if` statement performs **conditional execution**
- the `break` statement exits the enclosing loop

- the break condition can be modified using `all()` to allow computation of a vector of results
- this is less efficient since the loop only breaks when all results have converged so some results would be computed to a higher accuracy than required

```{r}
(y <- 1:10)
x <- y/2
repeat {
  x <- (x + y/x)/2
  if (all(abs(x*x - y) < 1e-10)) break
}
x
x^2
abs(x^2 - y)
```

- the `for` loop executes a statement for each value in a given set

```{r}
x <- seq(0,1,.05)
plot(x, x, ylab="y", type="l")
for (j in 2:8) lines(x, x^j)
```

- the `for` loop is executed with `j=2`, `j=3`, ..., `j=8`

## 2.3.2 Classes and generic functions

- in an **object-oriented** programming language each data object has a **class**
- a class defines the **methods** that act on the objects of the class
- different classes may contain methods of the same name, e.g. `print`
- R has some object-oriented features
- you can determine the class of an object using `class`

```{r}
class(TRUE)
class(42)
class("Ryerson")
```

- you can write a **generic function** by calling `UseMethod`

```{r}
print
```

- `UseMethod` calls the `print` method for the class of the object being printed
- you can list all the `print` methods using `methods()`

```{r}
head(methods(print))
```

- for example, `t.test()` returns an object of class `htest` (hypothesis test)

```{r}
(x <- t.test(bmi, mu=22.5))
class(x)
x$p.value
```

- when an object of class `htest` is printed, the `print.htest()` method is called
- if there is no `print` method for a class then `print.default` is called

## 2.4 Data entry

- this book uses example data sets provided by the `ISwR` package
- to analyse your own data you have to read it into R somehow
- you can read data from files, databases, the web
- you can also enter data manually
    - using `c()` is only practical for manually entering small data sets
    - R provides a data editor for manually entering larger data sets

## 2.4.1 Reading from a text file

- the most convenient function for reading data files into R is `read.table()`
- this function produces a new data frame
- the function requires that the data set is stored in a plain, flat, ASCII text file
    - create this type of file with a text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac OS X
- the first line of the file should contain a header that names the variables being measured
- the items in each line are separated by blanks, tabs, or other delimiters
- after the header (if present), each line of the file contains one row of data
    - each data row contains the measurements for one experimental unit
    - use the special value `NA` for missing data

- the `ISwR` package includes some data files in its `rawdata` subdirectory
- you can find the location of this subdirectory on your machine using `system.file()`
- the data for `thuesen` is stored in the file `thuesen.txt`

```{r}
thuesen.txt <- system.file("rawdata/thuesen.txt", package = "ISwR")
cat(readLines(thuesen.txt), sep="\n" )
```

- read this file into a new data frame
    - use the argument `header=T` because the file has a header line

```{r}
thuesen2 <- read.table(thuesen.txt, header = T)
thuesen2
```

- `read.table` assumes that any column that contains character data is a factor
- for example, consider the file `secretin.txt` which corresponds to the `ISwR` data frame named `secretin`

```{r}
secretin.txt <- system.file("rawdata/secretin.txt", package = "ISwR")
cat(readLines(secretin.txt), sep="\n" )
```

- note that row numbers are included
- read the file:

```{r}
secretin2 <- read.table(secretin.txt)
summary(secretin2)
```

- note that R detects that the first row is one item shorter than the rest which have row numbers, and intreprets it as a header
- the first variable is numeric, the rest are factors

- `read.table` orders the factor levels alphabetically, which may not be what you want
- you may therefore need to reorder the factor levels after you read the file

```{r}
levels(secretin2$time)
```

## 2.4.2 Further details on `read.table`

- `read.table` is very flexible and has many options
- consult the help system for full details
- here are some of the important options

### File format details

- specify the *field separator* using `sep=`
- specify the *NA strings* using `na.strings=`
- specify *quote* and *comment* delimiters using `quote=` and `comment.char`
- specify the handling of *unequal field count* using `fill=` and `flush=`

### Delimited file types

- the a a few variants of `read.table` that set the options to common values
    - these assume the first row is a header
- `read.csv` reads Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
- `read.csv2` is like `read.csv` except that comma is used as the decimal oint and semicolon is used as the field delimiter
    - useful for data from European countries
- `read.delim` is like `read.csv` except that TAB is the field delimiter
- `read.delim2` is like `read.csv2` except that TAB is the field delimiter

Function      | Decimal Point | Field Delimiter
--------------|---------------|----------------
`read.csv`    | PERIOD (.)    | COMMA (,)
`read.csv2`   | COMMA (,)     | SEMICOLON (;)
`read.delim`  | PERIOD (.)    | TAB
`read.delim2` | COMMA (,)     | TAB


### Conversion of input

- control conversion of strings to factors using `stringsAsFactors=` and `as.is`
- specify datatype of columns using `colClasses`
    - improves efficiency
    - skip unwanted columns using `NULL`

## 2.4.3 The data editor

- R has a spreadsheet-like user interface for editing data frames
- edit the `airquality` data frame:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
aq <- edit(airquality)
```

- this assigns the edited data frame to a new data frame
- you can edit a data frame in place using `fix()`

- note that on Mac OS X you may see a error message like:
"Error in check_for_XQuartz() : X11 library is missing: install XQuartz from xquartz.macosforge.org"
    - download and install the X11 library from <http://www.xquartz.org>
    
### Recommendation

- the data editor user interface is primitive compared to Excel
- use Excel instead and save worksheet in CSV format

## 2.4.4. Interfacing to other programs

- you may need to move data between R and other programs
- the simplest way to accomplish this is to export and import delimited text files in the other programs

- you can also use the `foreign` package
- it supports SPSS, SAS, Epi-Info, Stata, Systat, Minitab, and S-PLUS

- on Unix/Linux systems open Excel files using OpenOffice and export as CSV

- you can also use the Windows system clipboard
- select tabular data in Excel, then copy to clipboard
- then read the special "clipboard" file in R:

```{r, eval=F}
read.table("clipboard", header=T)
```

- you can read data from databases
- use the `RODBC` package to read ODBC database connection
- refer to "R Data Import/Export" <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.html>

### Recommendation

- text files are the simplest way to read data into R
- export other formats to CSV
- write database query results as CSV


## 2.5 Exercises

2.1 Describe how to insert a value between two elements of a vector at a given position by using the append function (use the help system to find out). Without append, how would you do it?

- for example, consider this vector of some names:

```{r}
some.names <- c("Alberta", "British Columbia", "Ontario", "Quebec")
```

- insert more names between "British Columbia" and "Ontario" (after position 2):

```{r}
more.names <- c("Manitoba", "New Brunswick")
```

- Solution 1: Use `append()`

```{r}
append(some.names, more.names, after=2)
```

- Solution 2: Without `append()`

```{r}
c(some.names[1:2], more.names, some.names[3:4])
```

2.2 Write the built-in data set thuesen to a Tab-separated text file with write.table. View it with a text editor (depending on your system). Change the NA value to . (period), and read the changed file back into R with a suitable command. Also try importing the data into other applications of your choice and exporting them to a new file after editing. You may have to remove row names to make this work.

```{r}
write.table(thuesen, file="thuesen.txt", row.names=F, sep = '\t')
cat(readLines("thuesen.txt"), sep="\n" )
```

- use a text editor to edit `thuesen.txt`, replacing `NA` with `.` (period), and save it as `thuesen-period.txt`
- to make this totally automated, we'll do the editing using the string find and replace function `sub()`

```{r}
lines <- readLines("thuesen.txt")
lines <- sub("NA", ".", lines)
writeLines(lines, "thuesen-period.txt")
cat(readLines("thuesen-period.txt"), sep="\n" )
```

- read `thuesen-period.txt` and print a summary

```{r}
summary(read.delim("thuesen-period.txt"))
```

- note that `short.velocity` is incorrectly interpretted as a factor

- read `thuesen-period.txt` with the correct `NA` option and print a summary

```{r}
summary(read.delim("thuesen-period.txt", na.strings="."))
```

- now `short.velocity` is correctly interpretted as numeric
